    """ Mixing class to support recording python function events in a
    `focused` way.

    The method is used along a function event based monitor. It mainly
    overrides the on_function_event method to only record events when the
    interpreter is working inside the predefined functions.

    Public
    ------
    functions : FunctionSet
        A set of function or method objects inside which recording will
        take place.

    Private
    -------
    _code_trackers : dictionary
        A dictionary of KeepTrack instances associated with the code object
        of each function in `functions`. It is used to keep track and check
        that we are inside the execution of one these functions when we
        record data.
